# Introduction

PragmaCSS is an **opinionated, practically oriented CSS library**. It combines the components-focused approach that we
know and love from "traditional" CSS frameworks like [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) or
[materialize](https://materializecss.com) with concepts from utility CSS libraries like [tachyons](https://tachyons.io/)
or [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/); Unifying them in a sane way while aiming for a sensible balance between
simplicity and feature-richness.

PragmaCSS is quite light-weight as it focuses on providing the most essential features, which include a
shallow **HTML reset**, a **grid system** with gap-control, **UI classes** for buttons, forms and
various other elements, as well as plenty of **utility classes** for colors, typography, alignment,
responsiveness, animation and much more. No JavaScript functionality is included, it's just CSS.

PragmaCSS is built with [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com), a very elegant, powerful and unrestrictive CSS
preprocessor. Stylus variables are used to configure all variable style attributes from a central file,
thus enabling you to effortlessly **customize** the entire style to your specific projects design needs.
