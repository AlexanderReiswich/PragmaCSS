# Introduction

PragmaCSS is an **opinionated, practically oriented CSS library**. It combines the components-focused approach that we
know from CSS frameworks like [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) or [materialize](https://materializecss.com)
with concepts from utility CSS libraries like [tachyons](https://tachyons.io/) or [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
and unifies them in a sane way, aiming for a sensible balance between simplicity and feature-richness.

PragmaCSS is quite light-weight as it offers on providing the most essential features, which cover all commonly
required aspects including a shallow **HTML reset**, a **grid system** with gap-control, **UI classes** for buttons,
forms and various other elements, as well as plenty of **utility classes** for colors, typography, alignment,
responsiveness, animation and much more.

PragmaCSS is built with [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com), a very elegant, powerful and unrestrictive CSS
preprocessor. Stylus variables are used to configure all relevant style attributes from a central file,
thus making it easy to **customize** everything to your specific projects design needs.
