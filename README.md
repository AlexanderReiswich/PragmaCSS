# PragmaCSS

<br>

> A configurable CSS library built on stylus.

<br>

**Warning:** PragmaCSS is in early development and should not be used for production.<br>
All class names are potentially subject to changes.

\
PragmaCSS embraces both atomic and semantic principles. This means you get the flexibility of atomic CSS without the
cryptic class names, making it intuitive to understand and memorize all available classes.

Class combinations are beautiful and understandable. Just to give you a taste:

```
<h2 class="primary bold headline spacing-m push-down">Some Headline</h2>
```

PragmaCSS also provides you with attractive and reasonable base styles for the most essential elements, which you
can customize through a Stylus variables file.

By offering both a wide array of utility classes as well as plenty of UI element classes — all of which can be
centrally configured — creating unique, customized UI's is very fast and easy.

PragmaCSS is separated into five parts:

**global.styl**\
The global stylesheet is purely a collection of Stylus variables. By default, it's filled with sensible defaults,
but in your project, you should create your own global.styl file and use it to customize all other parts of PragmaCSS.

**html.styl**\
A minimal stylesheet that serves to reset and normalize the look of basic HTML elements and set reasonable defaults.
It also can be configured to define default global attributes to the body.

**ui.styl**\
This file containts a base collection of classes for concrete UI elements such as buttons and form inputs. It
should be loaded before the other stylesheets so that the utility classes can be used as overrides.

**style.styl**\
The style file is used to customize the most essential elements of your page to your particular styleguide.
It defines colors, font-styles, form elements and buttons.

**utilities.styl**\
This file containts generic, low-level classes that serve a singular, specific purpose, but can be combined for
great effect - thus eliminating the need to create custom classes in many cases.

**layout.styl**\
This stylesheet provides you with classes to position and structure your content through containers, grids,
fixed / fluid columns, as well as various tools to alter the spacing of your elements.

### Usage

Note: Your project needs to have Stylus installed.

First, add the module to your project:

```
import PragmaCSS from 'pragma-css'
```

You can include the local path to any of the PragmaCSS Stylus files by using:

```
PragmaCSS.pathTo('html')
PragmaCSS.pathTo('utilities')
PragmaCSS.pathTo('layout')
PragmaCSS.pathTo('style')
```

You can also load the raw Stylus code of a file in this way:

```
PragmaCSS.load('html')
```
